By leveraging deep learning, our model enhances dermatological diagnosis, surpassing traditional methods in speed and precision.\nWe also compared our model with pre-trained architectures such as VGG16, MobileNet, Inception V3, and Sequential CNN, analyzing their performance on the same dataset. Our CNN demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency, processing images faster while maintaining high classification precision.\nThis study utilizes data augmentation techniques, TensorFlow ImageDataGenerator, and advanced model tuning to ensure reliability in real-world applications. Our findings contribute to AI-driven medical advancements, improving early detection and treatment in dermatology.\nView Publication\nDeep Learning-Based Brain Tumor Identification Using Custom CNN\nUnder Publication\nOur research presents a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model tailored for classifying four types of brain tumors using MRI scans: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Achieving a testing accuracy of 97.10%, the model leverages deep learning to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, speed, and consistency in neuroimaging.\nTo validate its performance, we compared our custom model against well-known pre-trained CNN architectures including Xception, ResNet50, EfficientNetB4, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2. Our custom CNN stood out by offering a strong balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-time medical applications, even in resource-limited settings.\nThe study employs data augmentation, dilated convolutions, and residual connections, alongside optimized training strategies using TensorFlow. This ensures the model can generalize well, even with limited labeled data — a common constraint in medical imaging.\nBy integrating AI into radiology workflows, our work contributes to earlier tumor detection, faster decision-making, and greater diagnostic reliability, aligning with the growing demand for intelligent healthcare systems.\n05\nGet in Touch\nName\nEmail\nMessage\nSend Message on WhatsApp\n© 2025 Mirza Yoosha Minhaj.

It uses a machine learning model trained on weather data from NASA's POWER API combined with real-time AQI data from the WAQI API. ## Features - **City-Based Forecasting**: Get AQI predictions for any city worldwide\n- **Daily Model Retraining**: Model automatically retrains daily with new data\n- **Interactive Heatmaps**: Visual representation of air quality by region\n- **Persistent Data Storage**: Models and historical data stored on GitHub\n- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with color-coded AQI categories\n- **Static Site Generation**: Can be deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages ## Deployment Options This application can be deployed in two ways: ### 1. Full Dynamic Application (Render, Heroku, etc.) The complete Flask application with real-time forecasting, automatic model retraining, and admin features. ### 2. Static GitHub Pages Site A pre-generated static version that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. This version:\n- Contains pre-generated forecasts for popular cities\n- Automatically updates via GitHub Actions\n- Stores all data and models directly in your GitHub repository\n- Eliminates the need for a separate data persistence pipeline ## Project Structure ```\naqi_forecast_app/\n│\n├── .github/workflows/ # GitHub Actions workflows for GitHub Pages\n├── app/ # Core application modules\n│ ├── models/ # Trained ML models\n│ ├── historical_data/ # Historical AQI and training data\n│ ├── backup_manager.py # Data backup/restore utilities\n│ ├── backend_utils.py # API and utility functions\n│ ├── data_manager.py # Historical data management\n│ ├── fetch_and_train.py # Model training pipeline\n│ ├── github_storage.py # GitHub data persistence\n│ ├── init_directories.py # Directory initialization\n│ ├── model_loader.py # Model loading and AQI classification\n│ ├── plot_heatmap.py # Heatmap generation\n│ └── scheduled_training.py # Automatic daily retraining\n│\n├── main.py # Main Flask application\n├── scripts/ # Utility scripts\n│ ├── build_static_site.py # Static site generator for GitHub Pages\n│ ├── deploy_to_github_pages.py # GitHub Pages deployment helper\n│ └── setup_github_integration.py # GitHub token and repo setup\n│\n├── static/ # Static assets and generated maps\n├── templates/ # HTML templates\n│ ├── admin.html # Admin panel\n│ └── index_enhanced.html # Main application UI\n│\n├── Procfile # Deployment configuration for Render/Heroku\n├── README.md # This file\n├── render.yaml # Render configuration\n├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies\n└── wsgi.py # WSGI entry point\n``` ## Setup for GitHub Pages Deployment To leverage GitHub Pages for hosting your app and storing data: 1. **Configure GitHub Integration**: ```bash python scripts/setup_github_integration.py ``` 2. **Build and Test Static Site**: ```bash python scripts/build_static_site.py ``` 3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: ```bash python scripts/deploy_to_github_pages.py ``` 4. **Setup GitHub Actions** (Optional): - Ensure your repository has the following secrets: - `WAQI_API_KEY`: Your World Air Quality Index API key The GitHub Actions workflow will: - Run daily to retrain the model with fresh data - Update the static site with new forecasts - Commit all data and models back to your repository - Deploy the updated static site to GitHub Pages ## Setup for Full Dynamic Application 1. **Install Dependencies**: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 2. **Set Environment Variables**: - `WAQI_API_KEY`: Your World Air Quality Index API key - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Personal Access Token for GitHub storage (optional) - `GITHUB_REPO`: Repository for data storage (optional, format: username/repo-name) 3. **Initialize Application**: ```bash python -c \"from app.init_directories import init_all; init_all()\" ``` 4. **Run the Application**: ```bash python main.py ``` ## Data Persistence Strategy This application uses a multi-layered approach to ensure data persistence: 1. **Local Storage**: All models and historical data are saved locally\n2. **GitHub Repository**: Data is automatically backed up to GitHub after each training session\n3. **Manual Backups**: Admin panel allows downloading/uploading backup files\n4. **Static Site**: Pre-generated forecasts are included in the static GitHub Pages site This ensures that even if deployed on platforms with ephemeral storage (like Render's free tier), your data will persist. ## How It Works ### Dynamic Application\n1. **City Selection**: User enters a city name\n2. **Geocoding**: App converts city name to latitude/longitude\n3. **Weather Data**: NASA POWER API provides weather metrics for the location\n4. **Real-time AQI**: Current AQI is fetched from WAQI API\n5. **Prediction**: ML model predicts AQI based on weather parameters\n6. **Training**: Model retrains daily using historical data ### Static GitHub Pages Site\n1. **Pre-generated Data**: Static site includes pre-generated data for popular cities\n2. **GitHub Actions**: Automatically updates data daily via GitHub Actions\n3. **GitHub Storage**: All data and models are stored in your GitHub repository\n4. **No Server Required**: Pure static HTML/JS/CSS that runs entirely in the browser ## AQI Categories - **Good** (0-50): Air quality is satisfactory\n- **Satisfactory** (51-100): Minor discomfort to sensitive people\n- **Moderate** (101-200): May cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease\n- **Poor** (201-300): May cause discomfort to most people\n- **Very Poor** (301-400): May cause respiratory issues\n- **Severe** (401+): Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases ## API Credits - [World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API](https://aqicn.org/api/)\n- [NASA POWER API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/services/api/) ## License MIT",

    "content": "Full README for 'FireGuard-Advanced-Firewall-Management-System': # FireGuard: Advanced Firewall Management System A comprehensive network security solution that provides multiple interfaces (GUI, Web, and CLI) for managing firewalls and applying security rules to block malicious IPs from Indicators of Compromise (IOC) lists. ## Project Overview FireGuard is designed to help network administrators effectively manage firewall rules by:\n- Uploading and processing IOC IP lists\n- Applying deny/block rules to multiple types of firewalls\n- Providing both GUI and web-based interfaces\n- Supporting various firewall vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto)\n- Offering different rule types (deny all, deny specific protocols/ports) ## Repository Structure The project is now organized into a clean, modular structure: ```\nfireguard/\n├── fireguard.py # Main entry point script\n├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies\n├── README.md # Project documentation\n├── data/ # IOC data files\n│ ├── ioc_ip_list.csv\n│ ├── ioc_ip_list.json\n│ └── ioc_ip_list.txt\n└── src/ # Source code ├── core/ # Core functionality │ ├── load_firewall.py │ ├── push_acl.py │ └── send_email.py ├── gui/ # GUI applications │ ├── firewall_gui.py │ ├── firewall_backend.py │ ├── firewall_data.py │ ├── login_gui.py │ └── upload_ioc.py └── web/ # Web applications ├── flask/ # Flask implementation │ ├── app.py │ ├── firewall_backend.py │ ├── firewall_data.py │ ├── static/ │ └── templates/ └── django/ # Django implementation ├── manage.py ├── firewall_app/ └── firewall_project/\n``` ### Core Module\n- Core functionality for firewall management and rule generation\n- Email notification system\n- Firewall device management ### GUI Module\n- Tkinter-based desktop application\n- Authentication interface\n- IOC list upload and management\n- Firewall rule application ### Web Module\n- Flask and Django web application implementations - RESTful APIs for firewall management\n- User authentication and session management\n- Responsive web interfaces ## Features - **Authentication System**: Secure login for accessing the firewall management system\n- **Multiple Interface Options**: - Command-line interface - Desktop GUI application (using Tkinter) - Web interface (both Flask and Django implementations)\n- **IOC List Management**: - Upload IOC IP lists via CSV, JSON, or TXT formats - Manual entry of individual IOC IPs\n- **Firewall Operations**: - Block/unblock IP addresses - Apply different types of rules (deny all, deny ICMP, deny HTTP/HTTPS, deny SSH) - Support for multiple firewall vendors\n- **Notification System**: - Email notifications for rule application status ## Architecture FireGuard follows a modular architecture that separates core functionality from presentation layers: ```\n+------------------+ +------------------+\n| User Interfaces | | IOC Sources |\n+------------------+ +------------------+\n| - GUI (Tkinter) | | - CSV Files |\n| - Web (Flask) | <-----> | - JSON Files |\n| - Web (Django) | | - Manual Input |\n+------------------+ +------------------+ | | v v\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n| Core Engine |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n| - Firewall Rule Generation |\n| - ACL Management |\n| - Notification System |\n+--------------------------------------------------+ | v\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n| Firewall Integration |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n| - Cisco IOS Commands |\n| - Juniper Commands |\n| - Palo Alto Commands |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n``` This architecture allows for:\n- Separation of concerns between UI and business logic\n- Flexibility to add new firewall types without changing the UI\n- Easy extension with new features and interfaces ## Data Formats The system supports IOC data in multiple formats:\n- CSV (`ioc_ip_list.csv`)\n- JSON (`ioc_ip_list.json`)\n- Plain text (`ioc_ip_list.txt`) ## Installation ### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.x\n- Required Python packages: - tkinter (for GUI) - flask (for Flask web app) - django (for Django web app) - pandas (for data processing) ### Setup Instructions 1. Clone the repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mirzayoosha/fireguard.git\ncd fireguard\n``` 2. Install required packages:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n``` 3. Choose your preferred interface using the main script: ```bash\n# Launch the GUI application\npython fireguard.py --gui # Launch the Flask web application\npython fireguard.py --flask # Launch the Django web application\npython fireguard.py --django\n``` You can also run each component directly from its source location if preferred. ## Usage ### Desktop GUI Application\n1. Launch the application\n2. Login with your credentials (default: admin/admin)\n3. Enter an IOC IP address or upload an IOC list\n4. Select the rule type (block/unblock)\n5. Apply the rule ### Web Interface\n1. Start the web server (Flask or Django)\n2. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 (Flask) or http://localhost:8000 (Django)\n3. Login with your credentials\n4. Use the web interface to manage firewall rules ## Default Credentials\n- Username: admin\n- Password: admin or password123 (depends on implementation) ## Simplified Execution For Windows users, a batch file is provided for easy launching of any interface: ```\nrun_fireguard.bat\n``` This will present a simple menu to choose which interface to launch. ## Future Enhancements\n- Integration with threat intelligence platforms\n- Real-time monitoring of blocked IPs\n- Enhanced reporting and analytics\n- Multi-user role-based access control\n- API for programmatic access\n- Support for additional firewall vendors\n- Integration with SIEM systems\n- Automated threat response workflows ## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!

It features an intuitive and interactive web interface built with **Gradio**, enabling users to effortlessly transform textual descriptions into compelling visual art. The application is designed to be highly customizable, supporting various artistic styles, image filters, custom resolutions, and the generation of multiple images from a single prompt. The development journey, as detailed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook, progresses iteratively, building from fundamental image generation capabilities to advanced customization and a more polished, user-friendly interface. ## Features * **Text-to-Image Generation**: Convert your creative textual descriptions into high-quality images.\n* **Artistic Styles**: Infuse your generated images with distinct aesthetics by choosing from \"Photorealistic,\" \"Painting,\" or \"Sketch\" styles.\n* **Image Filtering**: Apply post-processing effects like \"Sepia\" or \"Black & White\" filters to further customize your visuals.\n* **Resolution Control**: Select desired output image dimensions (e.g., 512x512, 512x640, 640x512) to fit various use cases.\n* **Multiple Image Output**: Generate up to 5 diverse images from a single text prompt, providing more options.\n* **Inference Steps Adjustment**: Fine-tune the diffusion process by adjusting the number of inference steps, impacting both image quality and generation time.\n* **Gradio Web Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly and interactive graphical interface for seamless interaction with the model.\n* **Imgur Upload (Simulated)**: Includes a function demonstrating how generated images could be uploaded to Imgur, providing shareable links (note: a valid Imgur API Client ID is required for live functionality).\n* **Stylized UI with Sidebar**: Features custom CSS to create a visually appealing and organized Gradio interface, complete with a navigation sidebar for an enhanced user experience. ## Project Structure and Evolution The provided Jupyter Notebook cells guide you through the iterative development of this project: 1. **Basic Setup & Core Generation**: * Initial environment setup, including installation of essential Python libraries (`diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, `safetensors`, `gradio`). * Authentication with the Hugging Face Hub, a prerequisite for downloading the Stable Diffusion model. * Loading of the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model. * Demonstration of fundamental image generation: taking a text prompt, generating a single image, and then displaying and saving it locally. 2. **Gradio Integration (Initial)**: * Integration of the core image generation logic into a basic Gradio web interface. * Users can input a text prompt, trigger image generation via a button, and view the result, which is also made available for direct download. 3. **Adding Styling, Quantity, and Size Options**: * Expansion of the Gradio interface to include interactive elements for **artistic style** (dropdown with \"Photorealistic\", \"Painting\", \"Sketch\"), a slider for **number of images** (ranging from 1 to 5), and a dropdown for **initial image size** (512x512, 1024x1024). * The underlying image generation function is updated to dynamically incorporate these new user-defined parameters. 4. **Adding Filters and Imgur Upload**: * Introduction of a dropdown menu for **image filters** (\"None\", \"Sepia\", \"Black & White\") for post-processing. * Implementation of an \"Upload to Imgur\" button and a corresponding textbox to display the generated Imgur link, showcasing external API integration (requires a valid Imgur API Client ID for live operation). * A dedicated `apply_filter` function is added to apply selected visual effects to the generated images. 5. **Refined Gradio UI with More Controls**: * Further refinement of the Gradio interface to offer more granular control to the user: * An expanded **resolution** dropdown with additional options like \"512x512\", \"512x640\", and \"640x512\". * A **steps** slider, allowing users to control the number of inference steps, directly impacting the detail and quality of the output. * The primary generation function, `ui_generate`, is updated to seamlessly handle all these new parameters. 6. **Stylized Gradio UI with Sidebar**: * Demonstration of applying custom CSS within Gradio to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing and organized layout, featuring a distinct sidebar for potential future navigation (the navigation buttons are currently placeholders). * The core image generation logic remains consistent, but it is now presented within this enhanced and visually appealing user interface. ## Technologies Used * **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language.\n* **Diffusers**: Hugging Face's library for state-of-the-art diffusion models, making it easy to work with Stable Diffusion.\n* **Transformers**: Hugging Face's foundational library, often a dependency for `diffusers`, providing various NLP and vision tools.\n* **Accelerate**: A Hugging Face library that simplifies the process of running PyTorch models across different hardware configurations (e.g., GPUs).\n* **SafeTensors**: A modern, safe, and fast format for storing and loading machine learning model tensors.\n* **Gradio**: An open-source Python library that allows for quickly building and sharing interactive web applications for machine learning models.\n* **PyTorch**: The underlying deep learning framework used by the Stable Diffusion model.\n* **PIL (Pillow)**: A powerful image processing library for Python, used for displaying, saving, and applying filters to images.\n* **Requests**: A popular and easy-to-use HTTP library for making web requests, utilized here for the (simulated) Imgur API interaction. ## Setup and Installation To set up and run this project on your local machine or in a cloud environment like Google Colab, follow these instructions. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage dependencies. 1. **Clone the Repository (or access the notebook content):** ```bash git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git) cd your-repo-name ``` *(If you are directly using the provided Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab, you can skip this cloning step and proceed to run the cells.)* 2. **Install Dependencies:** ```bash pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors gradio Pillow requests ``` *(The initial cells in the Jupyter Notebook already contain `!pip install` commands to ensure all necessary libraries are installed within your environment.)* 3. **Hugging Face Authentication**: A Hugging Face access token is essential for downloading the Stable Diffusion model. * Visit your [Hugging Face Settings/Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) page. * Generate a **new token** and ensure it has at least `read` access. * When prompted during the execution of the notebook, paste your copied token into the input field. ```python from huggingface_hub import login from getpass import getpass token = getpass(\"Enter your Hugging Face access token: \") login(token=token) ``` ## How to Run 1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: * If you have downloaded the `.ipynb` file, open it with a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab). * Alternatively, upload the notebook directly to Google Colab for a convenient cloud-based execution.\n2. **Execute Cells Sequentially**: * Proceed to run each code cell in the notebook from top to bottom. * The initial cells will handle the necessary library installations and the Hugging Face authentication process. * Subsequent cells will then load the Stable Diffusion model into memory and launch the interactive Gradio web interface.\n3. **Interact with the Gradio Application**: * Once a Gradio application is successfully launched, the notebook output will display a local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) and, if enabled (as is common in Google Colab), a public shareable URL. * Open this URL in your preferred web browser to begin interacting with the text-to-image generator. ## Visuals and Diagrams ### Project Architecture Flow This diagram illustrates the core components and data flow within the application. ```mermaid\ngraph TD A[User Input: Prompt, Style, Resolution, Filters] --> B(Gradio Web Interface) B -- Sends request --> C{Python Backend Logic} C -- Loads model --> D[Hugging Face Hub: Stable Diffusion Model] D -- Model weights --> C C -- Generates image(s) --> E(Image Generation: Diffusers Library) E -- Raw image(s) --> F[Post-processing: Image Filtering, Resizing] F -- Processed image(s) --> G(Generated Images) G -- Displays results --> H[Gradio Web Interface: Output Display] G -- Optional upload --> I[External Service: Imgur API] H --> J[User: View & Download Images] I -- Returns URL --> H H --> K[User: Share Imgur Link]\n``` ## Future Enhancements We plan to expand the capabilities of this project with the following features: * **Video Generation**: Integrate models capable of generating short video clips from text prompts.\n* **Image-to-Image Translation**: Develop functionality allowing users to upload an image and transform it based on a new text prompt.\n* **ControlNet Integration**: Add support for ControlNet to provide more precise control over generated image attributes, such as pose, depth maps, or edge detection.\n* **Multiple Model Support**: Implement an option for users to select from various Stable Diffusion versions or other text-to-image models.\n* **Negative Prompts**: Introduce the concept of negative prompts to guide the model away from generating undesired elements in the output.\n* **User Accounts & Persistent Gallery**: For a production-ready application, implement user authentication and a persistent gallery to allow users to save, manage, and revisit their generated images.\n* **Robust Error Handling**: Enhance the application's error handling mechanisms, particularly for external API calls (e.g., Imgur) and model inference processes.",
